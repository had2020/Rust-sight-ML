This project is on hold until pigs fly.
Mainly because Rust is just too new for ML, for me.
I will return, once I learn how to do this in python. 

Pretty much it, it was going to be a ML algorithm, which predicts if an image is pizzia or not.
It failed because I could'nt get a cross entorpy method working on my metal npu, and with other devices I got a whole array of issues, with every single loss method out their for this libary.
Since I'am not a math wiz, combined with a shader king, I will put this project on hold, till I play with to torch or MLX in python :C
